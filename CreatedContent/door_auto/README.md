This is the automatic door. Assets include:

* Static Mesh for the left door "door_auto_door"
* Blueprint for the door, including a TimeLine for an 'animation', which is triggered when the player enters the collision volume.

Frame from the door_vert asset is reused here, since both doors are the exact same shape.
