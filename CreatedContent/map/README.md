This is the map for the game. 

**Current Build**

* Stages s1-s3, s4a, s5a are all mapped out, textured, and "hooked up".
* Landscape is formed in a general sense - could be improved,
* Inital material placed on landscape

**ToDo (required)**

* Finish lighting inside areas
* Remould certain areas of the landscape to better resize for scale.
* Implement a layered material to allow for things like rocks, grass, etc to be textured differently.
* Add visibility layer mask (tried multiple times, kept breaking things) to allow door to actually open.
* Mirror s4a, s5a onto s4b, s5b.
* Add jumpad to s8

**ToDo (possible)**

* Redesign door to have it lay on floor & open as more of a hatch. (This would also require the next point)
* Redesign exit to outside to be jumpad instead of ramp.

**Noted issues**

Luke mentioned the last upload didn't work properly, so I've moved it into this folder to try a fresh upload. If it still doesn't work, I'll just throw up a Google Drive link instead.
